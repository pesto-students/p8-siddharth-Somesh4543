        “Warning: If you are reading this then this warning is for you. Every
        word you read of this useless fine print is another second off your
        life. Don't you have other things to do? Is your life so empty that you
        honestly can't think of a better way to spend these moments? Or are you
        so impressed with authority that you give respect and credence to all
        that claim it? Do you read everything you're supposed to read? Do you
        think every thing you're supposed to think? Buy what you're told to
        want? Get out of your apartment. Meet a member of the opposite sex. Stop
        the excessive shopping and masturbation. Quit your job. Start a fight.
        Prove you're alive. If you don't claim your humanity you will become a
        statistic. You have been warned.”

            You are not your job, you're not how much money you have in the
            bank. You are not the car you drive. You're not the contents of your
            wallet. You are not your fucking khakis. You are all singing, all
            dancing crap of the world.

          <h3>This Is Your Life, And It's Ending One Minute At A Time.</h3>
          <p>
            Fight Club promotes the idea that individuals need to regain control
            of their own lives, instead of being trapped in the corporate
            working class while dreaming of higher ambitions but never reaching
            them. The film follows a man who feels suffocated in his 9-5 job,
            who fills the void with material things as a way to define himself.
          </p>
          <h3>You Are The Same Decaying Organic Matter As Everything Else.</h3>
          <p>
            The disillusioning belief that we are all special and unique can be
            critiqued as an unrealistic viewpoint that ends up misleading
            individuals to a harsh reality. Those who believe in the idea of
            becoming famous, promised by the American dream if they work hard
            enough, fall hard into a sense of broken promises and resentment.
